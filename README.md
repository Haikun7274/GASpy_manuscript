# GASpy_manuscript

This repository contains various scripts/notebooks we used to create [our
paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-018-0142-1). Please note that the
exact text and formatting of the figures in this repository are not likely to
be exactly as they appear in the paper, because there were revisions during the
editing process.

We have also included two JSON files that contain our CO and H data, along with
a Jupyter notebook (`read_data.ipynb`) that shows you how we turn the JSON
items into `ase.Atoms` objects.
